	If your browser closes after signing the first transaction to create your organization but before the second transaction appears in your Ethereum provider, or you are otherwise unable to sign the second transaction for any reason, then leave a message on <a href="https://spectrum.chat/aragon" target="_blank">Spectrum</a> describing what happened. At their soonest availability, someone from the Aragon development team will then help you create, sign, and broadcast the second transaction.</li>

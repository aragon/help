	 If you are having trouble performing an action that you expect you should be able to perform
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure Aragon has permission to access your Ethereum provider. If you see a button that says "Enable account" in the top-right corner of the Aragon client, then click that button and allow Aragon to access your Ethereum account. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Make sure your Ethereum provider is unlocked, on the correct network, and open to the correct account. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Make sure you are setting the proper <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/" target="_blank">gas limit</a> and paying a reasonable <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">gas price</a>. Your Ethereum provider <em>should</em> pre-fill the correct gas limit and gas price, but sometimes it will pre-fill the amounts too low. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>If you are using a hardware wallet such as Ledger, make sure you have "Contract data" enabled. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work..</li>
	<li>Reload the page in your browser. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Go to the Settings page and click the “Clear application cache” button. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Check the connection status in the top-right of the Aragon client. It should say “Connected to the network”. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Make sure your computer is properly connected to the internet. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Make sure all of the software in your toolchain is up-to-date: your browser, your Ethereum provider, your hardware wallet firmware, etc. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>
	<li>Try disabling and re-enabling or un-installing and re-installing any browser extensions that may be faulty, including your Ethereum provider/ wallet browser extension. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...</li>

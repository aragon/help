	The Aragon Court Dashboard is the central app where all dispute-related tools are available for jurors. It also contains detailed information about past and current disputes, including evidence, rulings, timeline, and much more. The following guide presents an overview of the various sections of the Dashboard.

<p>
	 By default, the Dashboard is accessible to all users at 
	<a href="https://court.aragon.org" target="_blank">court.aragon.org</a>. General information and statistics are available on the main page as well as more specific information related to disputes, tasks, and jurors in their respective page. However, it is when the app is connected to an Ethereum account that it really comes alive and offer its full potential.
</p>
<p>
	 In order to connect your Ethereum account to the Aragon Court Dashboard, simply click on the 
	<strong>Enable account</strong> button at the upper right and select the provider of your choice:

<p>
	<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5c98a4fe0428633d2cf3fcf7/images/5e3afb8204286364bc94e69f/file-LFyNx8NQFc.png">The first section you will see at the top of the Dashboard contains your ANJ balance information. This section is divided into three columns: <strong>My wallet</strong>, <strong>Inactive</strong> and <strong>Active</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>My wallet</strong> shows the amount of ANJ that your Ethereum wallet currently contains and its relative value in US dollars. Those tokens are not being managed by the Court and are at any given time fully under your control. To activate them and increase your chances of being drafted as a juror, you can click the <strong>Activate</strong> button at the bottom of the section and a side panel will appear asking for the amount of ANJ that you want to activate. The amount will be transferred to the <strong>Active</strong> section once the transaction is executed.
</p>
<p>
	 If you don't own any ANJ tokens, you can click the 
	<strong>Buy ANJ</strong> button at the top right of the dashboard. <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/44-how-to-get-anj-and-become-an-aragon-court-juror" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about the various ways to obtain ANJ.
</p>
<p>
	 The second column contains your 
	<strong>Inactive</strong> ANJ balance along with its value in US dollars. Inactive ANJ is held in the Court contract but doesn't increase your probability of being drafted. Two actions are available when you have an inactive balance:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Withdraw: </strong>Will withdraw a specified portion of the inactive ANJ to your wallet.</li>
	<li><strong>Activate: </strong>Will activate a specified portion of the inactive ANJ and transfer it to the <strong>Active</strong> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 The third column contains your 
	<strong>Active</strong> ANJ tokens. Active tokens serve three main purposes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They determine your probability of being drafted as a juror. The higher the amount, the higher the probability.</li>
	<li>Subscription rewards are directly proportional to active tokens. <a href="#rewards">Click here</a> to learn more about the different types of rewards.</li>
	<li>In order to incentivize consensus decisions and honest behaviors, a portion of your active ANJ is locked when drafted for a dispute and you can get rewarded or penalized depending on the final ruling. <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 The 
	<strong>Deactivate</strong> button can be used to transfer ANJ tokens to an inactive state. It's important to note that tokens <strong>do not</strong> get deactivated immediately, but only at the start of the next term. There is a possibility that you can still be drafted to rule on a dispute before your tokens are deactivated. After you rule on the dispute, then your deactivated tokens will enter an inactive state.
</p>
<p>
	 Each column contains its own history of recent transactions executed in the last 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
	 Finally, at the top of the section, you can see in real-time your probability of being drafted as a juror. The more ANJ you have activated relative to the rest of the ANJ other jurors have activated, the higher the probability will be.
</p>
<h4 id="tasks"><a href="#tasks">3. Tasks</a></h4>
<p>
	<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5c98a4fe0428633d2cf3fcf7/images/5e3afb9704286364bc94e6a1/file-wDXzdB4mgc.png">Aragon Court requires certain tasks to be executed at various points in the lifecycle of a dispute. Some tasks can be executed by anyone while others are strictly assigned to specific accounts. You can quickly see every task assigned to you along with their due date in the <strong>Upcoming Tasks</strong> section of the main page. A page dedicated to tasks is also available by clicking the <strong>Tasks</strong> menu item in the left side panel.
</p>
<p>
	 If you are concerned about missing important tasks, don't worry, if you signed up for email notifications then notifications about your tasks will be sent directly to your email inbox.
</p>
<p>
	 The following list contains every task you may encounter:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Draft jury:</strong> This task must be executed at the beginning of a round to select the jurors. Anyone can execute this task by clicking on the "Draft jury" button of the dispute. A small DAI reward is granted for successfully executing the task.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Commit vote:</strong> One of the most important tasks in Aragon Court. When a juror is drafted to adjudicate a dispute, their duty is to review the submitted evidence and commit a vote within the voting period limit. Failure to execute this action would penalize the juror. <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#voting-period" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information about committing votes.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Reveal vote:</strong> Since votes are secret until the end of the voting period, a task is also needed in order for the ruling to be revealed. However, an option is available to make this task fully automated. <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#vote-reveal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about revealing votes.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Appeal ruling:</strong> Once the ruling is revealed, it can be appealed by anyone who disagrees with its result. Be aware that you need to lock an amount of DAI to appeal a ruling. You will get rewarded if the ruling ends up turning in your favor at the end of the dispute. Learn more about appeals <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#appeal" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Confirm appeal:</strong> To officially appeal a ruling and launch a new adjudication round, a second account also needs to lock an amount of DAI to confirm that there is indeed a need for an appeal. Learn more about appeal confirmation <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#appeal" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Execute ruling:</strong> If no appeal has been requested and confirmed within their respective periods of time, the "Execute ruling" task is available to finalize the dispute. <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#ruling" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about final rulings.

</p>
<p>
	<strong>As a juror:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Subscription fees:</strong> You earn a monthly reward, in DAI, proportional to your active ANJ, whether you are drafted or not. </li>
	<li><strong>Dispute fees:</strong> If drafted, you earn a 10 DAI reward for ruling in favor of the dispute's final ruling. </li>
	<li><strong>Ruling fees:</strong> The locked ANJ tokens of jurors who voted in the minority in a given dispute are redistributed to jurors who voted in the majority according to the final ruling. Ruling fees are automatically transferred to your inactive wallet. Click <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-dispute-lifecycle#ruling" target="_blank">here</a> for further information about ruling fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>As a normal user:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maintenance action fees:</strong> Certain tasks (e.g. draft jury, execute ruling) reward the user with a small amount of DAI.</li>
	<li><strong>Appeal Fees: </strong> Anyone can earn a reward in DAI for successfully appealing a dispute (i.e. correctly predicting a dispute's final ruling).

	<strong>More information about subscription rewards</strong>
</div>
<div>
	As  mentioned above, through subscription fees activated jurors can earn a  monthly reward, in DAI, proportional to their active ANJ, whether they  are drafted or not. However, there are a few relevant factors jurors  should consider about how these rewards are computed. Subscription  rewards can be claimed by jurors after each Court period. Note that  Court periods are not the same as Court terms. Each Court period last 90  Court terms, and with each term lasting 8 hours, this means each Court  period lasts exactly 30 days.
</div>
<div>
	Since subscription rewards are  computed based on the active ANJ each juror has, we need to define a  checkpoint in the whole Court period to check these balances and assign a  portion of all the subscription fees to each juror. Since a juror's  balance can change during each period, to avoid gaming we are using the  randomness assigned to the first Court term of the following period,  i.e. a future event that cannot be known beforehand (see 
	<a href="https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court/blob/master/contracts/subscriptions/CourtSubscriptions.sol#L813">L813</a>).  This effectively means that the longer jurors keep their ANJ activated,  the higher their chances to receive a portion of the subscription fees  being assigned among them.
	<div>
		For example, for the first  period of Aragon Court, the resulting random checkpoint was the Court  Term #84. This means if you had the minimum necessary ANJ activated in  Court Term #84, then you are eligible to claim rewards for the first  Court period.
	</div>
	<p>
		 So, to increase your chances of receiving  subscription rewards after each Court period, you should keep your ANJ  activated as long as possible.

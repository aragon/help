	 ANJ (Aragon Network Juror) is the native token of Aragon Court, which jurors need to activate in the Court to be selected and earn dispute fees. The use of ANJ helps align the incentives of jurors with the long-term health of the Court, ensuring the Court's integrity. The following tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to get ANJ in order to become an 
	<a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/41-aragon-court" target="_blank">Aragon Court</a> juror.

<p>
	Important notice to jurors
	<br>
	If you acquire ANJ through any method other than by using the conversion module at 
	<a href="https://anj.aragon.org" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a>, then to receive Aragon Court juror notification emails you must send a message through the contact form at <a href="https://help.aragon.org" target="_blank">help.aragon.org</a> to let us know the email address you want to use for Aragon Court notifications and the Ethereum address that you will use to interact with Aragon Court. You can also contact us this way if you need to change your email or Ethereum address. In the future, email notification management will be available directly in the Court Dashboard interface.
</p>
<p>
	 Please be aware that if you do not sign up for email notifications, you will have to check the Aragon Court Dashboard regularly on your own to see if you have any juror tasks to perform, and if you do not perform these tasks on time, you will lose money for failure to perform your juror tasks. Due to the risk of losing money, we strongly suggest that you sign up for email notifications.

<h2 id="conversion-module"><a href="#conversion-module">Conversion module at anj.aragon.org</a></h2>
<p>
	<strong>Step 1. Check the ANJ conversion rate</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Currently, jurors must hold and activate at least 10,000 ANJ to be eligible for drafting and earning subscription fees. Visit 
	<a href="https://anj.aragon.org/" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a> to check the current ANJ conversion rate for the token you want to use to purchase ANJ. The conversion module on <a href="https://anj.aragon.org/" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a> currently supports buying ANJ using ANT, DAI, ETH, and USDC.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Step 2. Get one of the supported tokens to buy ANJ</strong>
</p>
<p>
	You can purchase one of tokens supported by the ANJ conversion module (ANT, DAI, ETH, or USDC) on various exchanges such as 
	<a href="https://uniswap.io" target="_blank">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://dex.ag/ANT" target="_blank">DEX.AG</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.aragon.org/network/aragon_network_token/#trade-ant" target="_blank">other token exchanges</a>. If you already have enough of one of these tokens and you want to use the tokens to buy ANJ, you can skip this step.
</p>

	<strong>Step 3. Convert your tokens into ANJ</strong><br>

</p>
<p>
	 Then use the conversion module to convert your tokens into the desired amount of ANJ.
</p>
<h2 id="bonding-curve"><a href="#bonding-curve">The ANJ bonding curve</a></h2>
<p>
	 ANJ is a continuous token, the supply of which is regulated by a 
	<em>bonding curve</em>. A bonding curve is an automated market maker smart contract that defines a relationship between token price and token supply.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	 ANT is the reserve token used to back the ANJ supply. As more ANT is deposited in the ANJ bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ increases; as ANT is withdrawn from the bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ decreases.
</p>
<p>
	 The bonding curve is used to convert ANT into ANJ and back at pre-defined rates. The way the ANJ bonding curve is set up, the more ANT is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer new ANJ will be released back to the sender; the more ANJ is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer ANT will be released back to the sender.
</p>
<p>
	 You can find a technical explanation of bonding curves 
	<a href="https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves" target="_blank">here</a> and find the source code for the specific smart contract used for the ANJ bonding curve <a href="https://github.com/AragonBlack/fundraising/blob/next/apps/batched-bancor-market-maker/contracts/BatchedBancorMarketMaker.sol" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Convert using the ANJ bonding curve<br>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	 You can convert ANT to/from ANJ directly through the ANJ bonding curve using the conversion interface at 
	<a href="https://convert.aragon.org" target="_blank">convert.aragon.org</a>. Click the arrows in the middle of the screen to change the direction of your conversion. Enter the amount you want to convert, then click the "Convert" button at the bottom of the screen to confirm your transaction.

</p>
<p>
	Using the bonding curve to convert ANT to ANJ requires multiple transactions. If one of these transactions fails for some reason, you can follow the instructions in the 
	<a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/45-various-topics-and-troubleshooting#convert" target="_blank">troubleshooting guide</a> to complete the transaction.

<h2 id="uniswap"><a href="#uniswap">Convert to ANJ/ANT on Uniswap</a></h2>
<p>
	 Go to 
	<a href="https://uniswap.exchange/swap" target="_blank">Uniswap</a> and convert obtained <code>ANJ</code> tokens to <code>ANT</code>, or vice versa. You can convert the ANJ tokens to any other token or <code>ETH</code>, but getting <code>ANT</code> / <code>ANJ</code> back makes it easier to repeat the operation.<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5c98a4fe0428633d2cf3fcf7/images/5e62a92904286364bc965aa1/file-LWN1QtMrXB.png">
</p>
<h2 id="bots"><a href="#bots">Source code packages</a></h2>
<p>
	 If you want to do this programatically, instead of using Etherscan and Uniswap frontend, these are the packages you need:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>@ablack/fundraising-aragon-fundraising</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 Install dependencies, compile contracts and you have ABI files in 
	<code>build/contracts</code> as usual in a truffle project.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Uniswap</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 Download the repo and install dependencies.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;code&gt;git clone &lt;https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts-vyper&gt; cd contracts-vyper  pip3 install virtualenv virtualenv -p python3 env source env/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
<p>
	 Then to get the ABI you can use:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;code&gt;vyper -f abi contracts/uniswap_exchange.vy
</pre>
<p>
	 Alternatively, you can use the Solidity version from 
	<a href="https://github.com/PhABC/uniswap-solidity" target="_blank">this repo</a>.

ANJ (Aragon Network Juror) is the native token of Aragon Court, which jurors need to activate in the Court to be selected and earn dispute fees. The use of ANJ helps align the incentives of jurors with the long-term health of the Court, ensuring the Court's integrity. The following tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to get ANJ in order to become an

<h4 id="ant"><a href="#ant">1. Check the ANJ conversion rate</a></h4>
</p>
<p>
Currently, jurors must hold and activate at least 10,000 ANJ to be eligible for drafting and earning subscription fees. Visit 
	<a href="https://anj.aragon.org/" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a> to check the current ANJ conversion rate for the token you want to use to purchase ANJ. The conversion module on <a href="https://anj.aragon.org/" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a> currently supports buying ANJ using ANT, DAI, ETH, and USDC.
</p>
<h4 id="ant"><a href="#ant">2. Get one of the supported tokens to buy ANJ</a></h4>
<p>
You can purchase one of tokens supported by the ANJ conversion module (ANT, DAI, ETH, or USDC) on various exchanges such as 
	<a href="https://uniswap.io" target="_blank">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://dex.ag/ANT" target="_blank">DEX.AG</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.aragon.org/network/aragon_network_token/#trade-ant" target="_blank">other token exchanges</a>. If you already have enough of one of these tokens and you want to use the tokens to buy ANJ, you can skip this step.

</p>
<p>
	Then use the conversion module to convert your tokens into the desired amount of ANJ.

<h4 id="bonding-curve"><a href="#bonding-curve">The ANJ bonding curve</a></h4>
<p>
On the backend, the ANJ conversion module uses a bonding curve to regulate the ANJ token supply. A bonding curve is a smart contract that defines a relationship between token price and token supply. In this case, the bonding curve is used to convert ANT into ANJ and back. The more ANT is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer new ANJ will be released back to the sender, and vice versa. You can find a technical explanation of bonding curves

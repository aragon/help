	 Aragon Court is one of the core components of the 
	<a href="https://aragon.org/network/" target="_blank">Aragon Network</a>. It is a dispute resolution protocol that handles subjective disputes that cannot be solved by smart contracts. This is achieved by having a set of jurors drafted for each dispute who will vote to guarantee a certain ruling.

	 Jurors sign up to get drafted into the court by activating Aragon Network Juror (ANJ) tokens in Aragon Court's smart contract. The more tokens a juror has activated, the higher the probability of getting drafted. You can easily exchange your ANT, DAI, ETH, or USDC for ANJ at 
	<a href="https://anj.aragon.org/" target="_blank">anj.aragon.org</a>. Follow <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/44-how-to-get-anj-and-become-an-aragon-court-juror" target="_blank">this guide</a> for further details about acquiring ANJ.

<h4 id="plurality"><a href="#plurality">Plurality rule</a></h4>
<p>
	 Unlike traditional courts, Aragon Court jurors are not asked to rule impartially on disputes but instead are asked to rule the way they expect the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)" target="_blank">plurality</a> of jurors to rule. Aragon Court attempts to find what the subjective truth is (i.e. the most correct outcome of a dispute) with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)" target="_blank">Schelling game</a>. Every time a juror is drafted for a dispute, a portion of their activated tokens is locked until the dispute is finalized. To incentivize consensus, jurors who donâ€™t vote in favor of the final ruling have their locked tokens slashed. Jurors who vote in favor of the final ruling are rewarded with dispute fees and ANJ tokens from any jurors who voted for a minority ruling.

<h4 id="proof-of-stake"><a href="#proof-of-stake">"Proof of stake"</a></h4>
<p>
	 The Aragon Court is a permissionless protocol where any participant can come and go without asking for anyone's authorization. Therefore the protocol must function with integrity even in the presence of malicious actors, who may pose as multiple jurors at once to "Sybil attack" the Court. The defense against these attacks begins with a simple staking system where juror impact is weighted by their active stake of Aragon Court's native token (ANJ).
</p>
<p>
	 You may be thinking if a cartel gets a majority of ANJ, they'll have a majority weight and attack the system unopposed since they'll influence more than 50% of the decisions. However, Aragon Court uses multiple countermeasures including iterative appeals, commit and reveal voting, and locked withdrawal periods that are designed to dissuade a cartel from acquiring and misusing a majority of ANJ tokens.

<p>
	 Jurors are expected to perform certain duties and responsibilities, like reviewing arguments for a dispute and casting a vote. In order to help jurors properly execute their tasks, the Aragon Court Dashboard is available and provides all the tools they need. You can learn more about the Dashboard 
	<a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/42-aragon-court-dashboard" target="_blank">here</a> and the details of dispute resolution <a href="https://help.aragon.org/article/43-disputes-life-cycle" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
	 Before Aragon Court opens for general public usage, the 
	<a href="https://aragon.one" target="_blank">Aragon One</a> team is organizing a <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/juror-dispute-guide-app-mining/" target="_blank">precedence campaign</a> to test the Court protocol and build early trust and a positive reputation for the Court. During this campaign, only Aragon One will be submitting disputes to Aragon Court for jurors to rule on. Once development of the <a href="https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-agreements/" target="_blank">Agreements app</a> is complete, Aragon One will end the precedence campaign and open Aragon Court for general public usage so anyone will be able to secure their Agreements using Aragon Court.

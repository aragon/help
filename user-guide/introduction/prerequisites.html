<p>
	<strong>In addition to a working desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet with a decent internet connection, you will need the following to start using Aragon:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access to the Aragon client on one of the available platforms:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Up-to-date Aragon <a href="https://github.com/aragon/aragon-desktop/releases" target="_blank">desktop app</a> </li>
		<li>Up to date <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>/<a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium" target="_blank">Chromium</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, or <a href="https://www.opera.com/download" target="_blank">Opera</a> desktop web browser</li>
		<li>Up-to-date <a href="https://www.cipherbrowser.com/" target="_blank">Cipher</a>, <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">MetaMask</a>, <a href="https://www.opera.com/crypto" target="_blank">Opera</a>, or <a href="https://status.im/" target="_blank">Status</a> mobile Web3 browser.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>An Ethereum provider such as <a href="https://frame.sh/" target="_blank">Frame</a> or <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> and a compatible Ethereum hardware wallet such as <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a> or <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank">Trezor</a> if your Ethereum provider either does not have key management ("wallet") functionality built-in or you prefer not to use the built-in wallet functionality.
	<ul>
		<li>Ethereum providers are apps that provide access to the Ethereum network and support signing Ethereum transactions.</li>
		<li>Note that most mobile Web3 browsers have a built-in Ethereum provider and wallet functionality.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>If you are using Aragon on mainnet</strong>, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network ("mainnet"). You will then need to load your wallet with enough ETH to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH can be acquired from a <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/how-to-buy-ether/" target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH</a>. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">current “standard” gas price</a> times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH.</li>

	<li><strong>If you are using Aragon on testnet</strong>, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network ("Rinkeby"). You will then need to load your wallet with test-ETH for the Rinkeby test network. This test-ETH is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/" target="_blank">Rinkeby faucet</a> or post your Rinkeby testnet address on <a href="https://spectrum.chat/aragon" target="_blank">Spectrum</a> to receive test-ETH for free. Please wait patiently for an Aragon community member to see your message if you post your faucet request in an Aragon Spectrum channel.</li>
</ul>

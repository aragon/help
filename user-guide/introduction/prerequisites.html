	<strong>In addition to a working desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet with a decent internet connection, you will need the following to start using Aragon:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access to the Aragon client on one of the supported platforms:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Up to date <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>/<a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium" target="_blank">Chromium</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> desktop web browser</li>
		<li>Up-to-date <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.token.im/download" target="_blank">imToken</a>, <a href="https://status.im/" target="_blank">Status</a>, <a href="https://trustwallet.com/dapp" target="_blank">Trust</a> mobile Web3 browser.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you use a desktop browser, you will also need a Web3-enabled Ethereum provider such as <a href="https://frame.sh/" target="_blank">Frame</a> or <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> and an (optional, but more secure) compatible Ethereum hardware wallet such as <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a> or <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank">Trezor</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Ethereum providers are apps that provide your browser access to the Ethereum network and support signing Ethereum transactions.</li>
		<li>Mobile Web3 browsers generally have a built-in Ethereum provider and wallet functionality.</li>
		<li>Hardware wallets keep your private keys - the computer code that is used to sign transactions and authorize funds transfers - secured separately from your computer, protecting the private keys from malware that may be on your computer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>If you are using <a href="https://mainnet.aragon.org" target="_blank">Aragon on mainnet</a></strong>, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Main Ethereum Network ("mainnet"). You will then need to load your wallet with enough ether (abbreviated as "ETH") to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. ETH is a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum network and can be acquired from any <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/how-to-buy-ether/" target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH</a>. As a rough estimate of how much ETH you should start with, multiply 20,000,000 times the <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">current “standard” gas price</a> times 0.000000001 to find out how much ETH you need. For example, at a current standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should start with 0.2 ETH.</li>
	<li><strong>If you are using <a href="https://rinkeby.aragon.org" target="_blank">Aragon on testnet</a></strong>, you will need to set your Ethereum provider to use the Rinkeby Test Network ("Rinkeby"). You will then need to load your wallet with test-ETH for the Rinkeby test network. This test-ETH is used to pay for gas when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization. You can try the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/" target="_blank">Rinkeby faucet</a> or post your Rinkeby testnet address in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/672466989217873929/694844628586856469" target="_blank">Aragon Chat #support channel</a> to receive test-ETH for free. Please wait patiently for an Aragon community member to see your message if you post your faucet request in an Aragon Chat channel.</li>
</ul>

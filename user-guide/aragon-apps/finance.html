	 To send funds to your organization, you can create a deposit using the Finance app. Click the "New Transfer" button, open the "Deposit" tab, select the token you want to deposit, enter the amount and an optional reference note, then click the "Submit deposit" button.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note: For non-ETH tokens, two transactions may be required to make a deposit. The first transaction approves the Finance app to pull the deposit amount from your account balance, and the second transaction is the actual deposit transaction. This is a safety feature to prevent the Finance app from pulling more funds from your account than you have explicitly authorized.<br>

You can optionally add a reference note to provide more context for the transfer. Once you have filled out all of this information you can click the “Submit transfer” button to complete the action, if you have permission.

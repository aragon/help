<p>
	 Aragon uses the 
	<a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service</a> (ENS) to assign names to organizations.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note: The organization's ENS name currently cannot be changed.<br>

<h4 id="set"><a href="#set">2.5.4 Configure the parameters of the Voting app</a></h4>
<p>
	<em>Note: </em><em>The Voting app parameters currently cannot be changed from the Aragon frontend client. To change the Voting app parameters after your organization has been created, you must first initialize the permissions to change these parameters, then you can change the parameters using the <a href="https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html">aragonCLI</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Support</strong>
</p>
<p>
	 “Support” is the percentage of votes on a proposal that the total "Yes" votes must be greater than for the proposal to be passed. For example, if “Support” is set to 51%, then more than 51% of the votes on a proposal must vote “Yes” for the proposal to pass.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Minimum Approval %<br>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	 "Minimum Approval %" is the percentage of the total token supply that support for a proposal must be greater than for the proposal to be considered valid. For example, if the “Minimum Approval %” is set to 20%, then more than 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote "Yes" on a proposal for the vote to be considered valid.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Vote Duration</strong>
</p>
<p>
	 “Vote Duration” is the length of time that the vote will be open for participation. For example, if the Vote Duration is set to 24 hours, then tokenholders have 24 hours to participate in the vote. After the 24 hours is over, if the vote does meet the Minimum Approval % and/or Support requirements, then the vote will automatically fail. If the vote meets the Minimum Approval % and Support requirements by the end of the Vote Duration, then the vote will automatically be passed. This parameter cannot be changed after the organization is created.
